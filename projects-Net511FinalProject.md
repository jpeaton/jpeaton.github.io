# NET 511 - Telecommunications Systems Design & Analysis
#### a.k.a how the internet actually works, not just that it works

## Project Overview

This project was completed as the final deliverable for NET 511: Telecommunications Practicum and focused on designing a complete enterprise network from the ground up — including physical layout, wireless coverage, hardware selection, and total cost analysis.

Instead of configuring devices after the fact, the emphasis was on planning first: what to buy, where to place it, how fast it actually needs to be, and how much it all costs when someone has to sign off on the bill.

In short, this project answered:

“If this were a real building with a real budget, what would a reasonable engineer actually do?”

## What the Project Was Really About

At its core, this was a network design and justification project, not a theory exercise.

The work centered on designing a multi-floor office building network, including:

* Full network diagrams
    * Core, distribution, and access layers
    * Logical and physical topology
    * A network that makes sense on paper *before* it exists in reality
* Three-floor building layout
    * Floor-by-floor network planning
    * Equipment placement that respects physics, walls, and common sense
    * Cabling and routing decisions that don't assume infinite ceiling space
* Wireless access planning
    * Strategic WAP placement
    * Accounting for walls, signal loss, and layout constraints
    * Deciding where strong Wi-Fi coverage is critical vs where "good enough" is actually good enough
    * Matching Wi-Fi 6 expectations to the wired infrastructure behind it
* Switching & routing decisions
    * Selecting switches and routers based on real needs
    * Making sure port counts actually line up with the design
    * Evaluating 1 Gb vs 2.5 Gb access ports where Wi-Fi 6 made it necessary
    * Avoiding both under-provisioning *and* unnecessary "because it's cool" over-engineering
* Total cost & efficiency analysis
    * Building a total cost template
    * Comparing design options
    * Evaluating performance per dollar
    * Justifying why certain choices were worth it while others weren't
 
Every decision had to be defensible, not just technically correct.

## What I Built (Without Posting an Answer Key)

To keep this project academically responsible, the focus was on design reasoning, not publishing step-by-step configurations.

Deliverables included:

* A complete end-to-end network diagram
* Floor-specific infrastructure planning
* Wireless coverage reasoning tied to physical layout
* Hardware selection aligned with actual bandwidth requirements
* A cost comparison showing efficiency differences between design choices

The goal wasn’t “max everything." It was right-sizing the network so it works well without lighting money on fire.

## Skills Demonstrated

* Enterprise network design & planning
* Wireless layout and coverage analysis
* Switch and router selection based on requirements
* Bandwidth, port-capacity, and PoE considerations
* Cost modeling and efficiency comparison
* Technical documentation that someone else could realistically follow

## What I Learned

The biggest takeaway from this project was that good network design is mostly about tradeoffs.

You’re constantly balancing:

* Performance vs cost
* Coverage vs complexity
* Scalability vs over-engineering
* “Nice to have” vs “actually required”

I also learned that diagrams and cost breakdowns carry real weight. A design can be technically solid, but if you can’t explain why it’s worth the money, it probably won’t get built.

## Why This Project Matters

This project mirrors how real infrastructure work is done:

* Design before deployment
* Justify decisions clearly
* Account for physical constraints
* Plan for growth without guessing wildly
* Avoid expensive mistakes early

These are the same considerations used in enterprise networking, IT infrastructure, and systems engineering roles. Just with fewer whiteboards and more spreadsheets.

## Final Reflection

This project wasn’t about configuring devices — it was about thinking like a network engineer.

It reinforced that the best networks aren’t necessarily the fastest or most expensive ones, but the ones that are well-planned, well-justified, and easy to defend when someone asks why you built it that way.
