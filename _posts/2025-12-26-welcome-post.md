## Welcome!

Merry Christmas! This website will server as my home base for staying up to date on important news and information regarding the cybersecurity and IT world, the world that I'm currently living in. I'm an intern at a small/medium-sized law firm in downtown Chicago currently doing IT Support and Cybersecurity work. In short, I help people who are about to succumb to their demons (they didn't check to see if they are connected to the VPN), and I identify and find remediations for critical vulnerabilities (updates that were deferred indefinitely). I'm hoping to finish my Master's in Cybersecurity by this March (2026) and find a full-time job so I can finally start saving more than 2-3 months of rent. 

I hope that anyone who reads this will find some usefulness from the things I've learned and am learning, and I am mainly creating this site to help myself better understand the cyber world, show what I'm learning, and create a platform for documenting these kinds of things. 

## Who are you, and how did you get into my house?

My name is Jeremiah, my friends call me Jerri (or Jerry). I got my bachelor's degree from a small, all-male institution called Wabash College where I learned how to argue with people in a more professional way. My friends and family love that I can do this, and I tend to bring out this highly sought-after skill at Thanksgiving dinner. My degree was a B.A. PPE, standing for Philosophy, Politics, and Economics. It's an interdisciplinary major that focuses on the intersection between the three categories (surprisingly there's a lot of connections between them all). I learned how to communicate ideas clearly, research, and wrestle with ideas that I felt like I disagreed with, but had to figure out why and if I was truly correct. It was a rewarding experience, and it landed me a job as a technical recruiter in Chicago. 

As a recruiter, I was responsible for working with account managers and hiring managers at our client companies and assisting them with finding qualified talent for their openings, mainly in tech roles (although I did various industries and career fields). It was a very social job, constantly talking on the phone or to coworkers. I enjoyed the work environment, although the constant metrics and stress of earning commission made the work unattractive, and I wanted to use more problem-solving and technical ability that I knew I had. Thanks to my dad being in the military, I received GI Bill funding to pursue my Master's degree. I started in Computer Science, but ended up going the Cybersecurity route. I really enjoyed learning about networking, how data is sent and received, how we access the internet, what the internet really is, and so much more. What I really liked, though, was learning how people abuse these systems we've created, and how people in my career field are, in a way, superheros. They are those who can stop the bad guys in a way that no one else can. In the absence of supernatural abilities, humans learned to bend systems instead. The same technical ability that enables harm is what cybersecurity uses to prevent it. It's a fascinating topic and career field to be in, and I'm excited to be part of it!

## What can we expect?

You can expect stories, opinionated articles, and discoveries I find, as well as posts about some projects I'm working on and things I've discovered that may help you in the future, especially those who are not seasoned in the field like me.
