# Intro

A poem to set the scene:

> You stand on a stage,
> behind tall red curtains,
> heart racing,
> every muscle braced for the moment you practiced for.

> The curtains pull back.
> Lights explode overhead,
> white and unforgiving.

> A crowd—thousands deep—
> waiting to be impressed.

> You look down.

> Nothing.

> You’re naked.

> Laughter ripples outward,
> a wave you can’t outrun.
> You cover yourself,
> turn away,
> heat flooding your face.
> You’ve never felt smaller.

> Footsteps scramble across the floor.
> Shadows fall in front of you.

> Two figures step forward,
> blocking the glare,
> shielding what should never have been exposed.

> They stand firm.
> Unbothered.
> Protective.

> You breathe again.

> They turn to you and say,
> “I’ve got you.”

> It’s them.
> It’s always been them.

> TLS.
> And SSL.

This poem is of extreme cultural significance.

# What the Hell are You Talking About?

I'm talking about Transport Layer Security and Secure Socket Layer, bro! Unfortunately, they're not actual people. But what are they? They are *encryption algorithms*. More specifically, they are algorithms that encrypt data at the application layer of the OSI and TCP/IP model. In order to understand that sentence, you'll need a quick preface of a few concepts here. Let's break all of this down like you're five-years-old.

### The OSI and TCP/IP Model

I won’t go deep into the OSI or TCP/IP models, but here’s the idea.

They’re both maps that explain how a message gets from your computer to another computer.

Think of sending a letter.

Your message starts as just words.
Then it gets put into an envelope.
Then that envelope gets another label.
Then another.

Each step adds information about where it’s going, how it should travel, and how the other computer should read it.

That’s what the layers are doing.

The OSI model shows this process in 7 small steps.

The TCP/IP model shows the same process in 4 bigger steps.

The TCP/IP model is what the internet actually uses today, while OSI is mostly used as a teaching tool to explain what’s happening.

When the message reaches the other computer, the process happens in reverse.

Each layer peels off what it added,
until only the original message is left.
Exactly how it was sent.
