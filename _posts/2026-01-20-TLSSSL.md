# Intro

A poem to set the scene:

> You stand on a stage,
> behind tall red curtains,
> heart racing,
> every muscle braced for the moment you practiced for.

> The curtains pull back.
> Lights explode overhead,
> white and unforgiving.

> A crowd—thousands deep—
> waiting to be impressed.

> You look down.

> Nothing.

> You’re naked.

> Laughter ripples outward,
> a wave you can’t outrun.
> You cover yourself,
> turn away,
> heat flooding your face.
> You’ve never felt smaller.

> Footsteps scramble across the floor.
> Shadows fall in front of you.

> Two figures step forward,
> blocking the glare,
> shielding what should never have been exposed.

> They stand firm.
> Unbothered.
> Protective.

> You breathe again.

> They turn to you and say,
> “I’ve got you.”

> It’s them.
> It’s always been them.

> TLS.
> And SSL.

> This poem is of extreme cultural significance.
